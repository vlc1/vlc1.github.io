bio: |
  My research focuses on the development of advanced computational fluid dynamics algorithms for the large-scale numerical modeling of multi-scale, multi-physics, and multi-phase flows. I combine sharp-interface methods with high-performance computing (HPC) to accurately simulate heat, mass, and momentum transfers in complex flow configurations relevant to process engineering and energy conversion systems at the micro-scale.
